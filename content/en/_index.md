A pangenome is a collection of all the genetic information of a species. A human pangenome reference comprises a subset of the human pangenome and provides a graph-based, telomere-to-telomere representation that contains a more accurate and diverse representation of global genomic variation. There are many efforts underway to create human pangenomes. The Human Pangenome Project stems from the notion that humanity will be better served by an integrated, international pangenome rather than having tens or more human pangenomes.
